# Printf Project

This project involves the implementation of a custom printf function in C by Daniel Mensah and Franklin Ikeh. The project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and aims to replicate the behavior of the standard C library's `printf` functions.

## Background

The goal of this project is to write a custom `_printf` function that can produce output according to a given format. The project requirements include handling various conversion specifiers such as `%c`, `%s`, and `%%`.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options
- Files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style, and header files should be include guarded
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum 5 functions per file
- Prototypes of functions should be included in a header file called `main.h`
- Collaboration should be done through a single GitHub repository

## How to Use

To test the `_printf` function and its behavior, you can use the provided `main.c` file as an example. The file demonstrates the usage of the `_printf` function with different conversion specifiers. Note that you don't need to push the `main.c` file to the repository, as the project's main files will be used during compilation.
